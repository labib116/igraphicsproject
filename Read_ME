This project was done using igraphics library as a part of my CSE 102 course.


The main idea was to replicate a basic traffic signal and its application. The whole project was divided into three parts
1. 4 -Lane crossroad where all the roads intersect together and only one way movement is allowed
2. 6-lane crossroad where there is an extra lane for lane changing
3. A roundabout
Music and background sound was added
